A team player, detailed-oriented, responsible, committed and self-motivated engineer, Pkay has designed, implemented, and tested back-end and front-end applications using a variety of programming languages and technologies. 
Pkay also enjoys learning as much as teaching to help others fulfill their potential and to deepen his knowledge as well. You can find more about this on his Github Page [here](https://github.com/pkErbynn/learn-web-technologies).
